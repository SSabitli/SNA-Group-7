## Loading Data

```{r}
data(UKfaculty, package = "igraphdata")
```

## Network Exploration

```{r}
snafun::g_summary(UKfaculty)
```

```{r}
snafun::is_directed(UKfaculty)
snafun::is_weighted(UKfaculty)
```

```{r}
(verts <- snafun::list_vertex_attributes(UKfaculty))
(edges <- snafun::list_edge_attributes(UKfaculty))
```

## Visualizing the Network

This network consists of groups of university staff and their friendship levels in the form of weights. The best way to represent this network would be to colour in different faculties as separate colours and then show their relationships as different widths of edges. There are no further attributes so we cannot do more with the visualization.

### Informative Plot

```{r}
cols = c("lightblue","pink","khaki2","seagreen1")
igraph::V(UKfaculty)$color <- cols[igraph::V(UKfaculty)$Group]

groups <- factor(igraph::V(UKfaculty)$Group, levels = c(1,2,3,4),
                    labels = c("Faculty 1","Faculty 2","Faculty 3","Faculty 4"))

comm <- snafun::extract_comm_walktrap(UKfaculty)
png('Informative_Samir.png')
plot(comm, UKfaculty,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.3,
     edge.color = rgb(0,0,0, alpha = 0.15),
     vertex.frame.color = "black",
     vertex.label = NA,
     vertex.frame.size = 4,
     vertex.size = 6,
     vertex.shape = "square",
     vertex.color = igraph::V(UKfaculty)$color,
     edge.curved = TRUE,
     edge.width = igraph::E(UKfaculty)$weight^0.8,
     layout = igraph::layout.fruchterman.reingold)
title(main = "Friendships Among UK Faculty Members", cex.main=1,
      sub = "Informative Version")
```

### Funny Plot

```{r}
cols = c("lightblue","pink","khaki2","seagreen1")
igraph::V(UKfaculty)$color <- cols[igraph::V(UKfaculty)$Group]

groups <- factor(igraph::V(UKfaculty)$Group, levels = c(1,2,3,4),
                    labels = c("Faculty 1","Faculty 2","Faculty 3","Faculty 4"))

png('Silly_Samir.png')
plot(UKfaculty,
     edge.arrow.size = 0.3,
     edge.color = rgb(1, 0, 0.722, alpha=0.15),
     vertex.label = igraph::V(UKfaculty)$name,
     vertex.label.color = "white",
     vertex.label.cex = 0.75,
     vertex.frame.color = "blue",
     vertex.frame.size = 10,
     vertex.size = 13,
     vertex.shape = "rectangle",
     edge.labels = igraph::E(UKfaculty)$weight,
     edge.labels.color = "green",
     vertex.color = "black",
     edge.curved = TRUE,
     edge.width = igraph::E(UKfaculty)$weight^0.8,
     layout = igraph::layout.grid)
title("Friendships Among UK Faculty Members", cex.main=1,
      sub = substitute(paste(italic("Bad Trip "),"Version")))
```
