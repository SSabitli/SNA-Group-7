	abstract = {This paper reviews peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, its development in the {UK} and other countries,
and assesses the business and economic policy issues surrounding this new form of
intermediation. P2P platform technology allows direct matching of borrowers’ and lenders’
diversification over a large number of borrowers without the loans having to be held on an
intermediary balance sheet. P2P lending has developed rapidly in both the {US} and the {UK}, but
it still represents a small fraction, less than 1\%, of the stock of bank lending. In the {UK} – but
not elsewhere – it is an important source of loans for smaller companies. We argue that P2P
lending is fundamentally complementary to, and not competitive with, conventional banking.
We therefore expect banks to adapt to the emergence of P2P lending, either by cooperating
closely with third-party P2P lending platforms or offering their own proprietary platforms.
We also argue that the full development of the sector requires much further work addressing
the risks and business and regulatory issues in P2P lending, including risk communication,
orderly resolution of platform failure, control of liquidity risks and minimisation of fraud,
security and operational risks. This will depend on developing reliable business processes, the
promotion to the full extent possible of transparency and standardisation and appropriate
regulation that serves the needs of customers.},

	abstract = {Purpose
              The purpose of this paper is to highlight the important factors which need to be taken into consideration to manage a diversified team. It also aims to provide business managers and executives with a framework of how to best utilize and implement teams in the workplace so as to maximize both internal and external diversified skill sets and capabilities in team members.
            
            
              Design/methodology/approach
              An extensive review of existing literature was done to form the views of the authors on the issue. A strengths, weaknesses, oppositions, threats ({SWOT}) analysis of diversified teams was done with the help of secondary research. The concept is based on the author's own practical experience. A combination of primary and secondary research was used to highlight and strengthen the author views and opinions. The original ideas and basic concepts are based on the author's own experiences.
            
            
              Findings
              The study found the maximum benefits of a diversified team. The findings show that effective teamwork requires members to recognize the team as a unit with common goals, values, and norms. The more that team members identify with each other, the more likely they are to believe they hold similar goals.
            
            
              Research limitations/implications
              The paper is an attempt to express the real organizational scenario which is based on a sample of 20 corporate executives who dealt with a similar issue. The industries selected were in Delhi – {NCR}. There is reason to believe that if study had to be done in some other parts of the county, results may have been different. The sample taken was not very big, and was also non‐random. A large sample may have different results.
            
            
              Practical implications
              The study includes an extensive analysis of the organizational diversity and its impact on the performance of the organizations. This may help business practitioners to encourage diversity in the workplace while improving teamwork, communication and cooperation among team members.
            
            
              Originality/value
              The paper highlights the different attributes of a diversified team. With the help of primary research and well‐supported secondary research, a good attempt is made to trace the four corners of leading a diversified team. It can help future managers to guide a diversified team for good team performance.},

We found consistent evidence for a negative correlation between rational score and adherence to reverse biases, as well as overall biases, for all three pairs of reverse biases tested. Further, this effect of rational thinking was more pronounced for high experiential individuals, in that high-rational and high-experiential participants committed fewer biases than all other participants. These results lend weight to our claim that low-rational individuals, who are more sensitive to the context, are more prone to utilize some attribute of the provided information when it is uncalled for, but at the same time tend to ignore it or give it too little weight when it is a crucial factor in a normative decision process.},

We study herding behavior, defined as a greater likelihood of bidding in auctions with more existing bids, in P2P loan auctions on Prosper.com . The results of an empirical study provide evidence of strategic herding behavior by lenders such that they have a greater likelihood of bidding on an auction with more bids (a 1\% increase in the number of bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by 15\%), but only to the point at which it has received full funding. After this point, herding diminishes (a 1\% increase in bids increases the likelihood of an additional bid by only 5\%). We also find a positive association between herding in the loan auction and its subsequent performance, that is, whether borrowers pay the money back on time. Unlike {eBay} auctions where herding impacts bidders adversely, our findings reveal that strategic herding behavior in P2P loan auctions benefits bidders, individually and collectively.},

	abstract = {Online peer-to-peer (P2P) lending is a central component of Internet finance. It can help borrowers raise funds quickly—a particularly useful feature for small and medium enterprises and individuals with no credit on record with a central bank. In this paper, we use data from Chinese {RenRenDai} lending platform to investigate the relationship between loan purpose and funding success rate. In order to identify the purpose of borrowing from the title of the loan, {LDA} topic model of text mining technology is applied to make classification for loan titles. Our results indicate that the purpose of the loan has a significant influence on whether the loan is successful. Ambiguity surrounding the loan’s purpose significantly reduces the likelihood of a borrower successfully securing that loan. Loan purpose for business often ensures a higher funding success rate. These results suggest that borrowers should comprehensively fill out the loan title when applying for funding via an online P2P platform. Results also suggest that online P2P platform investors do not blindly invest in others in an attempt to secure high returns.},

	abstract = {[This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling.]},

We apply a Logit model to estimate the ex-post probability of default on both original variables provided by the database and factors obtained by Principal Component Analysis. Results show the fundamental role of borrowers’ education in reducing the probability of default, as with financial awareness obtained by loan characteristics. In addition, gender plays an important role in determining loan default, with a particular focus on women's conditions within the family.

These networks have two disjoint node sets representing distinct entity types, for example persons and groups, with edges representing associations between the two entity types. In bipartite graphs, the smallest possible cycle is a cycle of length four, and hence four-cycles are the smallest structure to model closure in such networks. Exponential-family random graph models ({ERGMs}) are a widely used model for social, and other, networks, including specifically bipartite networks. Existing {ERGM} terms to model four-cycles in bipartite networks, however, are relatively rarely used. In this work we demonstrate some problems with these existing terms to model four-cycles, and define new {ERGM} terms to help overcome these problems. The position of the new terms in the {ERGM} dependence hierarchy, and their interpretation, is discussed. The new terms are demonstrated in simulation experiments, and their application illustrated on a canonical example of an empirical two-mode network.},
