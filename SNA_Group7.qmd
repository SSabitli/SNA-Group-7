## Introduction {#sec-intro}

| Hypothesis | ERGM Term | Motivation |
|----|----|----|
| H1: Students who I consider friends also consider me their friend | `mutual` | The `mutual` term captures the tendency for outgoing ties to co-occur with incoming ties between actors, capturing the dynamic of reciprocation. |

## Methodology {#sec-methodology}

### Dataset {#sec-dataset}

The study utilises publicly-available data from Bondera
